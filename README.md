# Fampay-Task-Application

This application is developed as a task for Fampay recruitment process. The app displays a list of contextual cards whose information is being fetch from the given [API](https://run.mocky.io/v3/fefcfbeb-5c12-4722-94ad-b8f92caad1ad). The UI design was referenced from this [figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/AvK2BRGwMTv4kQab5ymJ0K/AAL3-Android-assignment-Design-Specs). 


## MVVM Architecture
The mentioned application is developed using Model View View Model or MVVM Architecture. This enables us to break the functionality of the app into various components thus, making it super easy to debug. 

## Networking
The network calls are made using Retrofit library.

## User Interface
I have used Material Design library to create the user interface of the mentioned application. Also, I used Facebook's shimmer layout library to give the app some nice loading effects
